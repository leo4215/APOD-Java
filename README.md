NASA APOD - Astronomy Picture of the Day
Author: Leonardo de Camargo

This project involves a responsive desktop application developed in Java to collect data from the NASA API: APOD - Astronomy Picture of the Day. One scene is responsible for collecting the data, while the second scene displays an image, a title, a date, and a description of the picture. The data retrieved in JSON format is converted to Java objects using the Gson library.

The purpose of this project was to create an application with two scenes: one for collecting data from the API and the other for displaying it. There is a method to switch between scenes.

Technologies used: JavaFX, Gson, SceneBuilder, CSS
